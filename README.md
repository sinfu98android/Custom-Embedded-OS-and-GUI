# Custom Embedded Operating System (Freeware Project)

I worked in R&D for video software from 2002 to 2008, and during that time — around 2007–2008 — I began developing my own Operating System (OS) from scratch.<br>

The OS started on AVR 8-bit CPUs, then was later ported to Toshiba 8-bit, Renesas R8C 16-bit, and ARM9 32-bit architectures. The GUI was implemented for the ARM9 platform, where I drove the LCD directly.

This OS is freeware, created for anyone interested in learning about operating system or embedded system design. It’s portable across multiple CPUs, and I recommend using IAR Embedded Workbench for the best compile results. <br>

**The project was paused due to a significant personal life event, after which my professional focus shifted to applied systems engineering**. <br>

When I have time, I plan to modify the OS to run directly on x86 hardware, flashing it into the BIOS SPI flash so it can boot without any external storage.<br>


If you’re interested in exploring or building upon it, feel free to use it!
